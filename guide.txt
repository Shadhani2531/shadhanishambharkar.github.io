I’m a B.Tech Computer Science student with a Minor in Data Science, aspiring to become a Data Scientist.
I like working on machine learning and data analysis projects, especially tasks like cleaning data, building models, and finding meaningful insights.
I enjoy applying analytical thinking to solve real problems and continue improving my skills through hands-on projects.
